# First steps

This is a collection of some of my very first personal projects in high school.  
I loved nothing more than spending hours trying to build these games from scratch using very basic technologies: C, SDL and OpenGL.  
I tried to compile all of them for Mac OS & Windows, you'll find all Makefiles for Mac OS inside each directory.
